A force F is applied on a area microelement of a cube's surface. There is extra stress because of this force. Let the stress as P. Obviously, P depends on F and the inherent properties of the material, which we set as M. We know the relationship between P, M and F. 
```
P = M * F
```
Let expand this formulation
```
Px=M11*Fx + M12*Fy + M13*Fz
```
M is a tensor, in fact.
