##### 01

Use value to calculate reference position. 

```
=INDIRECT("days!C" & A5*7-4)
```
Explanation:

1. `"days!C"`: This is the sheet and column part of the reference (column "C").
2. `A5*7-4`: This is the formula that calculates the row number.
3. `INDIRECT`: This function takes the concatenated string (which represents a cell reference) and converts it into an actual reference.
