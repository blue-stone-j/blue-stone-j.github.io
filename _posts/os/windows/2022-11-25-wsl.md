WSL mounts your Windows file system under the `/mnt` directory.

# compare WSL and docker

### feature

|Feature | WSL | Docker|
|---|---|---|
|Base | Runs a real Linux kernel (in WSL2) on Windows via Hyper-V | Uses Linux containers on a host OS|
|Isolation | Less isolated ‚Äî acts more like a Linux distro installed on Windows | Fully isolated environments per container|
|File System | Has access to the Windows file system (/mnt/c) | Containers have isolated file systems|

|Aspect | WSL | Docker|
|---|---|---|
|Code Editing | Use VS Code (Remote WSL), or edit directly in Linux paths | Typically mount code from host or build images with code|
|Dependency Management | Installed normally using apt/pip/etc. | Installed inside Dockerfile or with docker exec|
|Portability | Less portable ‚Äî code tied to your WSL setup | Highly portable ‚Äî run same container on any platform|
|Build Environment Isolation | Shared environment with your Linux setup | Fully isolated per container, easy to create clean slates|

|Use Case |Prefer WSL |Prefer Docker|
|---|---|---|
|CI/CD pipelines |‚ùå Not used directly |‚úÖ Widely used in DevOps pipelines|
|Performance-sensitive dev (I/O heavy) |üü° WSL2 has performance overhead| üü° Docker on Windows uses WSL2 backend (similar perf)|

##### GUI

Starting from Windows 11, WSL2 includes WSLg, which natively supports Linux GUI apps.

On Windows 10 (without WSLg): You need to install a third-party X server, such as `VcXsrv`, `Xming`. Set the DISPLAY variable in WSL: `export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}'):0`

|Feature | WSL (with WSLg) | Docker on Windows|
|Native GUI Support | ‚úÖ Yes (Windows 11+) | ‚ùå No native GUI|
|Qt/OpenCV/Matplotlib GUI | ‚úÖ Works out of the box | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs complex setup|
|X Server Required | ‚ùå (if WSLg), ‚úÖ (Win10) | ‚úÖ Always (e.g., VcXsrv or VNC workaround)|
|Performance | üü¢ Smooth | üî¥ Often slower, higher latency|
|Best for GUI App Development | ‚úÖ Recommended | ‚ùå Not ideal|

# QA

### 01

code:

```py
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
```

error:

```bash
Matplotlib is currently using agg, which is a non-GUI backend, so cannot show the figure.
```

solution

1. Use a GUI Backend with an X Server (Recommended for Visualizing) such as `VcXsrv`, `X410`, `Xming`.
2. In WSL2 terminal, set the DISPLAY environment variable: `export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}'):0
`. Or you can add it into `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.
3. (Optional) enable access to the X server: `export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1`
4. Install GUI backend dependencies if not already present: `sudo apt install python3-tk python3-pyqt5`
5. run code. Matplotlib should use a GUI backend like TkAgg or Qt5Agg and open a window.

You can switch backend manually if you have GUI support.
