WSL mounts your Windows file system under the `/mnt` directory.

# compare WSL and docker

### feature

|Feature | WSL | Docker|
|---|---|---|
|Base | Runs a real Linux kernel (in WSL2) on Windows via Hyper-V | Uses Linux containers on a host OS|
|Isolation | Less isolated — acts more like a Linux distro installed on Windows | Fully isolated environments per container|
|File System | Has access to the Windows file system (/mnt/c) | Containers have isolated file systems|

|Aspect | WSL | Docker|
|---|---|---|
|Code Editing | Use VS Code (Remote WSL), or edit directly in Linux paths | Typically mount code from host or build images with code|
|Dependency Management | Installed normally using apt/pip/etc. | Installed inside Dockerfile or with docker exec|
|Portability | Less portable — code tied to your WSL setup | Highly portable — run same container on any platform|
|Build Environment Isolation | Shared environment with your Linux setup | Fully isolated per container, easy to create clean slates|

|Use Case |Prefer WSL |Prefer Docker|
|---|---|---|
|CI/CD pipelines |❌ Not used directly |✅ Widely used in DevOps pipelines|
|Performance-sensitive dev (I/O heavy) |🟡 WSL2 has performance overhead| 🟡 Docker on Windows uses WSL2 backend (similar perf)|

##### GUI

Starting from Windows 11, WSL2 includes WSLg, which natively supports Linux GUI apps.

On Windows 10 (without WSLg): You need to install a third-party X server, such as `VcXsrv`, `Xming`. Set the DISPLAY variable in WSL: `export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}'):0`

|Feature | WSL (with WSLg) | Docker on Windows|
|Native GUI Support | ✅ Yes (Windows 11+) | ❌ No native GUI|
|Qt/OpenCV/Matplotlib GUI | ✅ Works out of the box | ⚠️ Needs complex setup|
|X Server Required | ❌ (if WSLg), ✅ (Win10) | ✅ Always (e.g., VcXsrv or VNC workaround)|
|Performance | 🟢 Smooth | 🔴 Often slower, higher latency|
|Best for GUI App Development | ✅ Recommended | ❌ Not ideal|
