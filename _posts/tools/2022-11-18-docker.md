I will use `7dd6d89ffda8` as container ID, `a294gh092j34` as image ID and `festive_edison:latest` as image name in my examples.

### transfer container

##### use docker commit

preserves the container as a Docker image with metadata

```bash
# Create an image from the container
docker commit my_container myimage:latest

# Save the image as a tar file
docker save -o myimage.tar myimage:latest

# Load the image on the other machine
docker load -i myimage.tar

# Run it on the new machine
docker run -it myimage:latest
```

##### use docker export

only the flat file system

```bash
# Export the container
docker export my_container > container.tar

# Import it on the other machine
docker import container.tar importedimage:latest

# Run it
docker run -it importedimage:latest /bin/bash
```

### image

1. list all local images

```bash
# with trunc SHA256 hash
docker images

# with entire SHA256 hash
docker images --no-trunc

# including dangling ones
docker images -a
```

2. delete image

```bash
docker rmi a294gh092j34
```

3. save image to file

```bash
# works with images and retains history and metadata.
docker save -o <output_file>.tar <image_name>
```

4. load file to image

```bash
# If you have a tarball created using docker save, use docker load instead. Both commands do the same thing, but the version with < uses shell redirection to handle it, whereas -i specifies the input file directly.
docker load < image.tar
docker load -i <path_to_tar_file>.tar
```

5. pull remote image

```bash
docker pull ubuntu:20.04
```

### container

1. start from an image

```bash
# create a container for image "ubuntu", start this container and step in it on command-line mode
# -v: map path in host to path in container 
# --name: set container's name, take "container5" as example. this option must be specified before specifying image.
# -i: interactive
# -t: command-line
# ubuntu:1.0, name and tag of image
# /bin/bash：放在镜像名后的是命令，这里我们希望有个交互式 Shell，因此用的是 /bin/bash。
docker run -v ./data:/media/data --name container5 -it ubuntu:1.0 /bin/bash

# here "--rm" is added. when you exit from container, this container will be deleted automatically.
# --gpus all: Make all available GPUs accessible inside the container
docker run --rm -it --gpus all my-cuda-dev
```

other configuration

```bash
# Soft cap; kernel tries to stay memory below it, but can still exceed on demand
--memory-reservation=512m
```

2. list all local containers

```bash
# list all local containers(-a including stopped contains)
docker ps -a

# check how much space a container is using (including writable layer)
# SIZE: the size of the writable layer (data written after container creation).
# virtual: total size including the image.
docker ps -s
```

3. get in a running container

```bash
docker attach 7dd6d89ffda8
```

4. import and export containers

```bash
# export container to file. works with containers and includes the filesystem without image history or metadata, like container name, port mappings, volumes, environment variables, and layers from the original image, CMD, ENTRYPOINT. the files stored in the container become part of the new image created during the import process.
docker export 7dd6d89ffda8 > ubuntu.tar

# import file as image "test/ubuntu:v1". a new image is created from the filesystem archive of the exported container. 
cat docker/ubuntu.tar | docker import - test/ubuntu:v1
docker import container.tar test/ubuntu:v1
```

5. find out which image a Docker container originated from

```bash
docker inspect 7dd6d89ffda8 | grep Image
# or
docker inspect 7dd6d89ffda8 --format='{{.Config.Image}}'
```

6. start a container

```bash
docker start 7dd6d89ffda8
```

7. CMD
The `CMD` is defined at the time of container creation. To change it, you must create a new container based on the existing one, overriding the `CMD`.

8. export container to image

Infomation below won't be reserved:

* Image history
* Environment variables
* Volumes
* Metadata like CMD, ENTRYPOINT, EXPOSE, etc.

```bash
docker commit 7dd6d89ffda8 festive_edison:tag
```

`7dd6d89ffda8` is container's name. Name of new image is `festive_edison`.

If this command is stopped by `crtl+c`, it will still occupy disk space, which means the file `docker_data.vhdx` will be large abnormally .Try to turn off Docker Desktop normally, or restart computer. Hope it can work.

1. delete a container

```bash
```

10. copy file or folder to host

```bash
docker cp my_container:/path/to/file /local/path
```

### setting

```json
```

### Docker Image Cross-Platform Usage

A Docker image or container exported on Ubuntu can generally be used on Windows, vice versa.

### display on Windows

##### install and launch XcXsrv on Windows

1. download from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv)
2. allow XcXsrv access all net
3. Select display setting: "Multiple windows" is default and recommended. Leave "Display number" as -1.
4. Select how to start clients: Leave it as default.
5. Extra settings: select "Disable access control".

##### configuration in docker container

1. install some package

```bash
sudo apt install xfce4-terminal
sudo apt install xfce4
sudo apt install x11-apps
```

2. edit .bashrc: add code below to file .bashrc and source it to enable it.

```bash
export DISPLAY=$(grep -m 1 nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | awk '{print $2}'):0
export WAYLAND_DISPLAY=$DISPLAY
export XDG_SESSION_TYPE=X11
```

Docker container can display now.

It's possible that you should configure `nameserver` in file `/etc/resolv.conf`. Open `PowerShell` and run `ipconfig` to check IP address. Replace IP address in `/etc/resolv.conf` with this address.

# docker desktop

`Reclaimable space` refers to disk space that is currently being used by Docker (e.g., by images, containers, volumes, or caches) but can safely be freed because it is no longer actively in use.

# configuration

This shows usage by images, containers, local volumes, and build cache.

```bash
docker system df
```

# example

### find and delete files

Docker-desktop on Windows. And if backend is wsl.

1. Verify what root dir that Docker uses

```bash
docker info --format '{{.DockerRootDir}}'
# (Usually /var/lib/docker)
```

The output value `./var/lib/docker` for this command is relative to the Docker daemon’s own mount namespace. In practice, it corresponds to /`var/lib/docker` inside the daemon.

The docker-desktop WSL distro is a special VM. Its root filesystem and mount namespaces are not the same as a normal Ubuntu distro, and you may not see `/var/lib/docker` unless you enter the daemon’s namespace as root.

2. Verify which distro has the daemon

```bash
docker info
```

If you find line like below, it means docker uses wsl as backend.

```yaml
Kernel Version: 5.x.y-…-microsoft-standard-WSL2
```

3. Open a root shell in docker-desktop(run in PowerShell)

```bash
wsl -d docker-desktop -u root

# if backend is windows, use "wsl -d docker-desktop-data -u root"
```

4. Enter dockerd’s mount namespace (critical)

```bash
# Get dockerd PID
pidof dockerd
# Example output: 123

# Enter its mount namespace so paths match what Docker reports
# use 123 as an example
nsenter -t 123 -m sh
```

If `nsenter` is not found, try `/usr/bin/nsenter`. It is usually available in docker-desktop.

5. Inspect usage inside the namespace

```bash
# Confirm the directory exists here
ls -ld /var/lib/docker

# Top-level usage
du -h -x -d1 /var/lib/docker | sort -h

# Largest single files (≥1 GiB)
find /var/lib/docker -xdev -type f -size +1G -printf '%s %p\n' | sort -nr | head -n 30

# Files modified in the last 24 hours (find active writers)
find /var/lib/docker -xdev -type f -mtime -1 -printf '%TY-%Tm-%Td %TH:%TM %s %p\n' | sort -nr -k3 | head -n 40
```

# other

##### 1. configuration file of docker

Configuration file of docker is `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. You can add code below to reset registry. It will be activated when docker is restarted.

```json
{
    "registry-mirrors": [
        "http://hub-mirror.c.163.com",
        "https://docker.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn",
        "https://registry.docker-cn.com"
    ]
}
```

##### 2. why need sudo

It's normal to require sudo when running Docker commands on Ubuntu by default. This happens because the Docker daemon (the service that manages Docker containers) runs with root privileges, and users who are not in the docker group must use sudo to access it.

##### 3. sudo and privileged

Using `sudo` affects only the host-side permissions to execute Docker commands, while `--privileged` changes the security model and capabilities within the container itself. They are separate and have different implications for container security and isolation.

##### 4. bind volume

You won’t be able to modify the bind mount directly because Docker doesn’t support changing mount options (like read-only) on an existing container, which means you have create a new container with a bind mount like command below:

```bash
# -v path on host : path on container
docker run -it -v /home/user/project:/usr/src/app festive_edison /bin/bash
```

##### 5. write speed

Speed of Writing on volume in container is much, much faster than that in bound volume. And speed of the latter isn't stable.

##### 6. update container configuration

```bash
# make a container won’t restart automatically
docker update --restart=no <container_id>
```

###### 7. reclaim host disk space from the VHDX

```powershell
# Close Docker Desktop and shut WSL down
wsl --shutdown

# Compact the Docker Desktop VHDX (requires Hyper-V tools)
$Vhd = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Docker\wsl\data\ext4.vhdx"
Optimize-VHD -Path $Vhd -Mode Full
```

Method mentioned above is the best. Below is another method, in case the last method isn't available.

```powershell
diskpart
select vdisk file="%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Docker\wsl\data\ext4.vhdx"
attach vdisk readonly
compact vdisk
detach vdisk
exit
```

If you can't attach vdisk successfully, try to restart computer and try again.

# Q&A

##### 1. docker and internet

```bash
net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
# 或
net/http: TLS handshake timeout
# 或
request canceled (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
```

or

```bash
Error response from daemon: Get "https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/": net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
```

or

```bash
Error response from daemon: Get "https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/": dial tcp ip: connect: connection refused
```

solution using VPN:

1. prepare a valid VPN
2. run `sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d` to create a folder
3. run `sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf` to create a configuration file.
4. run `sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf` to open it.
5. add configuration like below into it. Note that use your own proxy link.

```conf
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:8889/"
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:8889/"
```

6. restart docker using commands below

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

##### 2. several commands in dockerfile

problem: Got error when I used `Dockerfile` to create a docker image.
solution: perform every command in Dockerfile step by step manually.

##### 3. without default command

An error when run a image:

```bash
Failed to run image. (HTTP code 400) bad parameter - no command specified
```

reason: I created this image from a container and didn't add default cmd into this image.

solution: create a new `Dockerfile` based on the existing image.
If this image is linux-based:

```Dockerfile
FROM myimage:latest
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

If this image is Windows-based:

```Dockerfile
FROM myimage:latest
CMD ["cmd.exe"]
```

##### 4. interactive mode and command-line mode

container exit with code 0 at once when I start a container. </br>
reason: the container doesn't start with interactive mode and step in it on command-line mode.</br>
solution: I run `docker rum -it festive_edison:latest`. Note that command `/bin/sh` will be run automatically after a container start in this instance.

##### 5. KVM

I got `KVM is not enabled on host` when I started docker desktop.
`Docker Desktop` on Linux relies on a virtual machine as its backend. If `KVM` is not available, the default VM backend won't work. Use command `egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo` to check whether a CPU supports virtualization. If the output is 0, this CPU does not support virtualization, or it is disabled in the BIOS/UEFI.

##### 6. version of wsl

```bash
You don't have any WSL 2 distros installed. Please convert a WSL 1 distro to WSL 2, or install a new distro and it will appear here.
```

run `wsl --list --verbose` in `PowerShell` and I see infomation below

```plain
  NAME                   STATE           VERSION
* Ubuntu-20.04           Running         1
```

run `wsl --set-version Ubuntu-20.04 2` in `PowerShell` to convert it to WSL2.

##### 7. proxy

```bash
running wsl distro proxy in Ubuntu-20.04 distro: running proxy: exit status 1
```

##### 8. start docker

when I pull a docker image, there is an error like below

```bash
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
```

check status of docker by `sudo systemctl status docker`, and there is `Unit docker.service could not be found`.

when I run `sudo systemctl enable docker`, I got error like below

```bash
Failed to enable unit: Unit file docker.service does not exist.
```

It indicates that the docker service is not installed or its systemd service file is missing. We  need reinstall it.

First, remove any existing partial installation by `sudo apt purge docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc`.

Second, run commands below to install it.

```bash
# Add Docker’s official GPG key
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | \
  sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# Add Docker APT repository
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] \
  https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Update and install
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

Then start docker by `sudo systemctl enable docker`.

##### 9. proxy

```bash
Error response from daemon: Get "https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/": context deadline exceeded
```

run commands below to activate proxy

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d

sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf > /dev/null <<EOF
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:8888/"
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:8888/"
Environment="NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1"
EOF

sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

##### 10. display

```bash
error: XDG_RUNTIME_DIR not set in the environment.
[C]-[69772]-[17:42:34.814] unknown error happened: 'Pangolin X11: Failed to open X display'
```

Refer to [here](#configuration-in-docker-container).

##### 11. wrong log

"edwinat_loglens-desktop-extension" is an extension used in docker-desktop. Docker desktop was running when the power is cut off suddenly. And it looked like there were some damage in its container. This container logged extremely much.

Delete the ill container and this extension will build a new and healthy one automatically.
