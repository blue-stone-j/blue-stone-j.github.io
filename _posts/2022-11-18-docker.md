I will use `7dd6d89ffda8` as container ID and `a294gh092j34` as image ID in my examples. 

### image
1. list all local images
```bash
# with trunc SHA256 hash
docker images
# with entire SHA256 hash
docker images --no-trunc
```

2. delete image
```bash
docker rmi a294gh092j34
```

### container

1. start from an image
```bash
# create a container for image "ubuntu", start this container and step in it on command-line mode
# -i: interactive
# -t: command-line
# ubuntu: name of image
# /bin/bash：放在镜像名后的是命令，这里我们希望有个交互式 Shell，因此用的是 /bin/bash。
docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
```

2. list all local constainers
```bash
docker ps -a
```
3. get in a running container
```bash
docker attach 7dd6d89ffda8
```

4. import and export containers
```bash
# export container to file
docker export 7dd6d89ffda8 > ubuntu.tar

# import file as image "test/ubuntu:v1"
cat docker/ubuntu.tar | docker import - test/ubuntu:v1
```

5. find out which image a Docker container originated from
```bash
docker inspect 7dd6d89ffda8 | grep Image
# or
docker inspect 7dd6d89ffda8 --format='{{.Config.Image}}'
```

6. start a container
```bash
docker start 7dd6d89ffda8
```

7. CMD
The `CMD` is defined at the time of container creation. To change it, you must create a new container based on the existing one, overriding the `CMD`.

8. export container to image
```bash
docker commit 7dd6d89ffda8 image_nre
```
Name of new image is "image_nre".

##### 1. 
Configuration file of docker is `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. You can add code below to reset registry. It will be activated when docker is restarted.
```json
{
    "registry-mirrors": [
        "http://hub-mirror.c.163.com",
        "https://docker.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn",
        "https://registry.docker-cn.com"
    ]
}
```

##### 2. why need sudo
It's normal to require sudo when running Docker commands on Ubuntu by default. This happens because the Docker daemon (the service that manages Docker containers) runs with root privileges, and users who are not in the docker group must use sudo to access it.

##### 3. sudo and privileged
Using `sudo` affects only the host-side permissions to execute Docker commands, while `--privileged` changes the security model and capabilities within the container itself. They are separate and have different implications for container security and isolation.

##### 4. 
You won’t be able to modify the bind mount directly because Docker doesn’t support changing mount options (like read-only) on an existing container.

# Q&A
##### 1. 
```bash
net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
# 或
net/http: TLS handshake timeout
# 或
request canceled (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
```
or 
```bash
Error response from daemon: Get "https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/": net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
```
or 
```bash
Error response from daemon: Get "https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/": dial tcp ip: connect: connection refused
```

solution using VPN:
1. prepare a valid VPN
2. run `sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d` to create a folder
3. run `sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf` to create a configuration file.
4. run `sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf` to open it.
5. add configuration like below into it. Note that use your own proxy link.
```conf
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:8889/"
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:8889/"
```
6. restart docker using commands below 
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

problem: Got error when I used `Dockerfile` to create a docker image.
solution: perform every command in Dockerfile step by step manually.
