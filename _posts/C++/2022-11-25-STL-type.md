##### std::optional

`std::optional` is a C++17 standard library utility that represents an object that may or may not contain a value. It is a type-safe alternative to using special values (like nullptr or -1) to indicate “no result.”

You can find some examples here[https://github.com/blue-stone-j/example/blob/main/cpp/src/std/optional.cpp].

##### std::future

`std::future` is a C++ standard library class template (in <future>) that provides a way to access the result of an asynchronous operation. It represents a "handle" to a value that will be set at some point in the future, typically by an asynchronous task.

##### std::promise

`std::promise` is a synchronization primitive in the C++ Standard Library (<future>) that allows one thread (the producer) to provide a value or exception that another thread (the consumer) can retrieve through a corresponding std::future.

| Promise Action             | Future Reaction                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `set_value(v)`             | `get()` returns `v`                |
| `set_exception(e)`         | `get()` throws `e`                 |
| Destructor without setting | `get()` throws `std::future_error` |
| Value not ready yet        | `get()` blocks until ready         |

| Feature                | `std::promise`                           | `std::async`                         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Who manages the thread | You manage manually                      | Automatically creates/manages thread |
| When value is produced | When you call `set_value()`              | When async task completes            |
| Exception handling     | You must call `set_exception()` manually | Automatically captured               |
