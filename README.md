### resume

Literally, here is my resume. I remove personal information, of course.

### _config.yml

This file is configuration for this static site. Note that it's different from files in folder ".github".

### CNAME

I link Github Pages to my domain, which I bought from Aliyun. You can also get one if you are interested.

This is a shell to update last updated date for posts. It's deprecated now and this function is intergated into `pre-commit`.
